\section{Broader Impact, Education, and Outreach}
\label{sec:impact}

\paragraph{Broader Impact.} 
FIX ME.

We will add to the national computing infrastructure by implementing
and making available all of the component
systems we build as part of this project.  These tools will add to the national research and industry
software infrastructure. Our prior tools are in wide use in industry
and academia, and we expect these will be also.

\paragraph{Education.}
We plan to integrate the research developed here into both
undergraduate and graduate classes. FIX ME.

\paragraph{Outreach.}
Improving participation in computer science from underrepresented groups
requires outreach at multiple levels; the PIs have a strong track record
of this work at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

PI Berger has supervised undergraduate research and
mentored women and minority undergraduates. PI Berger has recruited undergraduates from
across the neighboring Five College consortium (which includes Amherst
and Hampshire Colleges, and two female-only undergraduate institutions,
Smith and Mt. Holyoke Colleges). FIX ME Alexandra stuff.

% PI Berger participated in a discipline
% CRA-W workshop for under-represented minorities in 2008.
