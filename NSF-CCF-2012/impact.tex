\section{Educational Impact and Outreach}
\label{sec:impact}

\paragraph{Educational Impact.}

Building and experimenting with new types of data debugging techniques
will create opportunities for students at all levels to become
involved in research. The PIs' goal is to encourage this participation
through class projects at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and
through direct involvement of the students in research. The PIs
commonly extract interesting sub-projects from their ongoing research
and offer them as class projects in their graduate classes at the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The PIs have also a history of
involving undergraduate students in their research, many of them women
and minority students.

Both PI Berger and PI Meliou regularly involve women and undergraduate
students in their research projects. PI Berger advised an
undergraduate student at Amherst College as part of a group designing
a JavaScript-based Java Virtual Machine implementation called Doppio,
which attracted national attention and led to an invitation to present
this work at the Strange Loop conference.  PI Meliou recently advised
an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in the design
of an interactive web interface to the Tiresias system, which won the
best demonstration award at SIGMOD 2012.

\paragraph{Outreach.}
Improving participation in computer science from underrepresented groups
requires outreach at multiple levels; the PIs have a strong track record
of this work at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

PI Berger has supervised undergraduate research and
mentored women and minority undergraduates. PI Berger has recruited undergraduates from
across the neighboring Five College consortium (which includes Amherst
and Hampshire Colleges, and two female-only undergraduate institutions,
Smith and Mt. Holyoke Colleges).

PI Meliou has supervised graduate and undergraduate students in
research projects. She is currently advising three students: one
female graduate student and two undergraduates (one male and one
female). PI Meliou is passionate about promoting the participation
of women and minorities in science through outreach efforts and
minority group leadership.
