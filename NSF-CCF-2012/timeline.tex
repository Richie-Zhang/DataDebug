\paragraph{Year 1.} % (fold)
\label{par:year_1}
During year 1, we will focus on the static analysis of spreadsheet functions, and SQL queries. We will study different functions, patterns, and query types. We will start experimenting both with synthetic and real-world data early, to assess the performance gains of static analysis.  At the end of year 1, we will start to evaluate the performance trade-off between alternative strategies.

\paragraph{Year 2.} % (fold)
\label{par:year_2}
During year 2, we will maintain our focus on small and medium scale data debugging. We will start to study optimization techniques based on static analysis. We will design and implement an optimizer for impact analysis in relational data, modeled after traditional database optimizers. Our design will be based on complexity results, and pattern-based heuristics.
As part of this work, we need to investigate query rewrites that may lead to more efficient impact calculations.

During year 3, the PIs will focus their efforts on augmenting MapReduce pipelines with impact monitoring tools. \comment{add stuff here}
