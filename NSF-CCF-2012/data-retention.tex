%\section*{Data Management Plan}

\subsection*{Data Collection}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project}

Data to be collected as part of this research include software source
code, human data entry experiments via Mechanical Turk, educational materials, performance results
including benchmark execution times and other performance
characteristics such as memory consumption and error-detection accuracy.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Data Storage}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{standards to be used for data and metadata format and content}

All results will be stored in comma-separated files (.csv
format). All other source code and output will be stored in ASCII text
or open database formats (e.g., XML). Educational materials will
comprise LaTeX files and PowerPoint presentations.

Scripts written in publicly-available languages like Python or Perl
will be used to drive all benchmarking. All scripts will be maintained
together with other source code products of this research.

\item \emph{policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements}

The data generated by this project will comprise only
publicly-available, non-confidential information. All source code will
be released under an open source license, such as the MIT or GNU General
Public Licenses.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Preservation, Documentation and Sharing of Data}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives}

All products from this project will be made publicly available both on
a departmental website and via a public source code version control
repository (e.g., \url{github.com}), including data, scripts, and source
code. By releasing code under the GNU General Public License, all
source code can be freely included in any open source project.

\item \emph{plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them}

All artifacts will be suitably documented. Additional copies of all
data and code will be archived on departmental backup systems (disks
on-site, and tapes off-site) to further ensure their preservation. In
addition, papers that present results based on our research will be
made available via the PIs' individual web pages.

\end{itemize}
