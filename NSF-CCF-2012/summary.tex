\noindent{\bf\textsf{Intellectual Merit.}} 

Data debugging, awesome.

\smallskip
\noindent{\bf\textsf{Broader Impact.}}  Data debugging will save the world.
The investigators will make their
benchmarks and tools publicly available, adding to the national
research infrastructure.

The investigators' prior tools and systems are widely used in research
and industry: the Hoard high-performance memory manager, the DieHard
error-tolerant and DieHarder secure runtime systems now incorporated
in Windows, \emph{Alexandra's stuff}. Educational impact will include
training graduate and undergraduate students in key language system
technologies, contributing to the technology workforce, and outreach
to under-represented groups via the inclusion of female students from
nearby Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges.
