\section{Summary}

\todo{Timeline}

We propose data debugging, an approach aimed at
finding potential data errors by locating and ranking data items based on their
overall impact on a computation. Intuitively, errors that have no
impact do not pose a problem, while values that have an unusual impact
on the overall computation are either very important or incorrect.
We present a prototype of the first data debugging
tool, \checkcell{}, which operates on spreadsheets. We evaluate
\checkcell{}'s performance analytically and empirically, showing that
it is reasonably efficient and effective at helping to find data
errors. \emph{FIX ME.}
