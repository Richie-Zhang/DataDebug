Data errors cost businesses millions to billions of dollars annually.
We propose \emph{data debugging}, a new paradigm that leverages
the interaction of data and computations to find, track, and withstand
data errors. Data debugging will dramatically reduce the risks of
human data entry errors and data corruption, and thus increase the reliability
of any computation over data.
