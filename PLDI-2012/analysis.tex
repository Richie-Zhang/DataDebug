Analysis to come.

\paragraph{Asymptotic analysis.}

Cost to construct dependence graph, cost to perform sampling. (Suspend redraw?)

\paragraph{Probability of missing important data.}

30 samples. Odds of missing something important are vanishingly small.
Cite Feller. Limitations: threshold functions.

\paragraph{Normal distribution of impacts.}

Justifies use of trimming (only reporting things that are two standard
deviations)--high confidence that they are outliers.  Average change,
independent (random), same distribution (don't exclude same cell
swap). Use 30 samples.

\paragraph{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Array formulas.}
\item {\bf Tables.}
\item {\bf Control flow / HLOOKUP / VLOOKUP.}
\item {\bf Outputs that change data type.}
\item {\bf Macros / side-effects.}
\end{itemize}
