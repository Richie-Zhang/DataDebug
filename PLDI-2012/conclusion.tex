Computations depend on correct inputs for their correct
operation. This paper presents data debugging, an approach aimed at
finding data errors by locating and ranking data items based on their
overall impact on a computation. Intuitively, errors that have no
impact do not pose a problem, while values that have an unusual impact
on the overall computation are either very important or incorrect.

We present the first data debugging
tool, \checkcell{}, which operates on spreadsheets. We evaluate
\checkcell{}'s performance analytically and empirically, showing that
it is reasonably efficient and effective at helping to find data
errors. \checkcell{} is available for download at
