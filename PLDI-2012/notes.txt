Data provenance:
Buneman has a lot of relevant work.  Particularly relevant to "result impact" is the work on view updates, for example: "On propagation of deletions and annotations through views".  Another option is the Stanford work on lineage, e.g., "Tracing the Lineage of View Data in a Warehousing Environment".  I also like "Provenance semirings" (Green et al).  It's one of the latest formalisms that captures various different types of data provenance under a unified framework.

Workflow provenance:
Work by Juliana Freire, Margo Seltzer, Susan Davidson.

PL + provenance:
"Functional Programs that Explain their Work", Perera et al
"Program Slicing and Data Provenance", James Cheney


* interesting post on typos:

* must note the homogeneity assumption for ranges (and somewhere, why we don't use VLOOKUP since it breaks the assumption that all cells in a range are semantically identical -- in VLOOKUP, the whole row must be treated atomically).
