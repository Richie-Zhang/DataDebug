\paragraph{Data Cleaning.}
Most past work on locating errors in data has focused on \emph{data
cleaning} (also known as \emph{data scrubbing}
and \emph{cleansing}~\cite{DBLP:journals/debu/RahmD00} in database
systems. EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS. Standard approaches include
statistical outlier analysis~\cite{FIXME}, interpolation to fill in
missing data (e.g., with averages)~\cite{FIXME}, and using
cross-correlation with other tables to correct or locate
errors~\cite{FIXME}. Section~\ref{FIXME} shows that statistical
outlier analysis often produces unacceptably large numbers of false
positives. None of these approaches leverage the interaction of data
with programs that operate on them, as data debugging does.

Programmatic approaches: AJAX~\cite{Galhardas:2000:AED:342009.336568}
expresses a data cleaning program as a DAG of transformations from
input to output. Data streams (also language-based, essentially
focused on smoothing, temporally and spatially~\cite{1617508}. Data
Auditor by Golab et al\.~cite{Golab:2010:DAE:1920841.1921060}:
requires rules and target relations entered by the programmer. By
contrast, CheckCell (and the notion of data debugging in general)
operates automatically by discovering data that have an unusual impact
on program output.

\paragraph{Spreadsheet Errors.}
Spreadsheets have been one of the most prominent computer applications
since the creation of VisiCalc in 1979~\cite{FIXME}. The most widely
used spreadsheet application today is Microsoft Excel~\cite{}. Excel
indicates errors in formula entry like division by zero, a reference
to a non-existient formula or cell, invalid numerical arguments, or
accidental mixing of text and numbers.

Excel can also check for inconsistency with adjacent formulas and other structural errors, which it
highlights with a ``squiggly'' underline.
